# Creating & Deploying a Subgraph

## What are Subgraphs?

- A subgraph is a custom API built on blockchain data.

- Subgraphs are queried using the GraphQL query language and are deployed to a Graph Node using the Graph CLI.

- Once deployed and published to The Graph's decentralized network, Indexers process subgraphs and make them available to be queried by subgraph consumers.

You can find more about subgraphs in the docs [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/).

## Step 1: Create your Subgraphüõ†

- Go to https://thegraph.com/studio
- Connect your wallet
- Click on `Create a Subgraph`
- Enter a name for your Subgraph

## Step 2: Installing The Graph CLIüì¶

The Graph CLI takes a subgraph manifest (defaults to `subgraph.yaml`) with references to:

- A GraphQL schema,
- Smart contract ABIs, and
- Mappings written in AssemblyScript.

It compiles the mappings to WebAssembly, builds a ready-to-use version of the subgraph saved to IPFS or a local directory for debugging, and deploys the subgraph to a [Graph Node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node).

To install The Graph CLI using `npm` or `yarn`, run the following command in your terminal:
```
#NPM
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graphcli

#Yarn
yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```

## Step 3: Initialize your Subgraphüß±

To initialize your Subgraph, run the following command:

```
graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```
> You can get your `SUBGRAPH_SLUG` from the Subgraph Studio

If you subgraph is successfully initialized, your terminal should look similar to this:
```
‚àö Protocol ¬∑ ethereum
‚àö Subgraph slug ¬∑ fordemo
‚àö Directory to create the subgraph in ¬∑ fordemo
‚àö Ethereum network ¬∑ sepolia
‚àö Contract address ¬∑ 0xf7e903969E1269147aAfc8915f889B2D918D4bE4
‚àö Fetching ABI from Etherscan
‚àö Fetching Start Block
‚àö Fetching Contract Name
‚àö Start Block ¬∑ 6378250
‚àö Contract Name ¬∑ YourContract
‚àö Index contract events as entities (Y/n) ¬∑ true
  Generate subgraph
  Write subgraph to directory
‚àö Create subgraph scaffold
‚àö Initialize networks config
‚àö Initialize subgraph repository
‚àö Install dependencies with yarn
‚àö Generate ABI and schema types with yarn codegen
Add another contract? (y/n):
Subgraph fordemo created in fordemo
```
> Enter the protocol and contract details according to your project.

## Step 4: Authenticate your Subgraph‚öôÔ∏è

Go to Subgraph Studio and copy your `Deploy key` from the `Dashboard`.

<img width="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b36f7ff6-8f8b-450b-b886-dcd4ef5a7110">

After copying the `Deploy key`, run the following command to authenticate your subgraph:

```
graph auth --studio <DEPLOY_KEY>
```

Output should look like this:

```
Deploy key set for https://api.studio.thegraph.com/deploy/
```

## Step 5: Codegen && Buildüèó

The command `graph codegen` generates AssemblyScript types for smart contract ABIs and the subgraph schema. And the command `graph build` compiles a subgraph to WebAssembly.

To do this, first change into the directory where the subgraph was created in the previous step.

```
cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>
```

and run:

```
graph codegen && graph build
```

Your output should look like this:

## Step 6: Deploy your SubgraphüöÄ

Now the final step to deploy your subgraph to the Subgraph Studio is to run the command:

```
graph deploy --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG>
```

On running this command, you will have to enter a version for your subgraph, for e.g. `v0.0.1`.

The output will look like this:

```
